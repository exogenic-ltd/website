content: |
  I'm a dedicated full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience in creating web applications that solve real-world problems. My journey began with a curiosity about how websites work, and it has evolved into a passion for crafting exceptional digital experiences.

  I specialize in modern web technologies including React, Next.js, Node.js, and various databases. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices to deliver high-quality solutions.

  When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge through blog posts and community involvement.
