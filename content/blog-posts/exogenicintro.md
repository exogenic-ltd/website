    title: "The Challenge We See"
    paragraph: "In Sri Lanka alone, over 32000 amputees face significant barriers to rehabilitation. Advanced prosthetic device exist, but they are prohibitively expensive, often costing LKR 35 million, where low-cost alternatives lack durability and functionality. On top of this, international products often come with limited local service and no coverage under public health programs. This creates a cycle where medical technology often falls into two extremes. On one side, ground breaking innovations remain trapped in labs, too expensive or complex to reach those who need them most. On the other, existing solutions fail to adapt to real-world challenges faced by patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers. This gap between and innovation and accessibility inspired the creation of Exogenic."
