title: "Understanding Myoelectric Control: The Science Behind Natural Movement"
overview:
  - introduction: "One of the most remarkable aspects of the Dexios Hand is its myoelectric control system – technology that translates your muscle signals into prosthetic movement. But how does this seemingly magical process actually work? Let’s dive into the science behind natural prosthetic control."

  - blockId: 1
    paragraph: "Every time you think about moving your hand, your brain sends electrical signals through your nervous system to your    muscles. Even when muscles are no longer connected to a limb, these electrical signals – called myoelectric signals – can still be detected and interpreted."

      title: "The Detection Process"
      bulletPointsWithDesc:
      - title: "Signal Capture"
        description: "Sensors placed on the skin detect the tiny electrical signals (measured in microvolts) generated by muscle contractions."
      - title: "Signal Processing"
        description: "Advanced algorithms filter out noise and amplify the relevant signals, distinguishing between different muscle groups and contraction patterns."
      - title: "Interpretation"
        description: "The processed signals are translated into specific commands for the prosthetic hand – open, close, adjust grip strength, or change grip pattern."
      - title: "Response"
        description: "The prosthetic responds in real-time, creating the experience of natural, intuitive control."
